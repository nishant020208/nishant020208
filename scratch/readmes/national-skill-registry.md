## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | React 18.3 with TypeScript, Vite 5.4, Tailwind CSS 3.4 |
| **UI Components** | shadcn/ui (Radix UI) with customized theming |
| **State Management** | React Query (TanStack) 5.83 |
| **Routing** | React Router 6.30 |
| **Backend** | Supabase (PostgreSQL database, Auth, Edge Functions, Storage) |
| **Authentication** | Supabase Auth with JWT token management |
| **Document Generation** | jsPDF 4.2 with AutoTable support |
| **Data Visualization** | Recharts 2.15 for analytics dashboards |
| **QR Code Generation** | qrcode.react 4.2, html5-qrcode 2.3 |
| **Form Management** | React Hook Form 7.61 with Zod validation |
| **Build Tool** | Vite 5.4 with SWC transpilation |

### Database Schema

The system utilizes a normalized PostgreSQL schema with the following primary entities:

#### Core Tables

- **institutions**: Registered ITI and Polytechnic centers with location metadata
- **students**: Student enrollments linked to institutions and optional auth users
- **skills**: Canonical skill taxonomy (15+ core technical competencies)
- **credentials**: Issued skill credentials with cryptographic hash, level (1-4), and status
- **credentials_logs**: Immutable audit trail of all credential state changes

#### Access Control

- **whitelist**: Email-based signup gating with role and institution assignment
- **profiles**: User profile data with role and institution affiliation
- **user_roles**: Security-critical table for role-based access control (RLS)

#### Request Management

- **reassessment_requests**: Student-initiated or staff-managed skill re-evaluation workflow

### Security Model

#### Row-Level Security (RLS)

All tables implement Supabase RLS policies enforcing institutional boundaries:

- **ITI Admins**: Full read/write access across all institutions
- **Principals**: Full read/write access to their assigned institution
- **Trainers**: Read access to students/skills; write access to credentials at their institution
- **Students**: Self-read access to profile and credentials; can request reassessment

#### Authentication Flow

1. User email must be whitelisted with designated role and institution
2. Supabase Auth creates JWT-authenticated user
3. `handle_new_user()` trigger automatically provisions `profiles` and `user_roles` records
4. Role-based routing directs user to appropriate dashboard (`/admin`, `/principal`, `/trainer`, `/student`)

#### Credential Verification

Public verification endpoints require no authentication:
- Verification pages accept credential hash or student ID via URL parameter
- QR codes encode institution + credential hash for secure public lookups
- Public RLS policies allow anonymous access to student and credential metadata

---

## Data Seeding and Demo Environment

### Seed Architecture

The system supports large-scale data seeding via two dedicated Supabase Edge Functions:

#### `seed-dataset` Function
- Streams 50,000-row dataset in batches to avoid timeout/memory limits
- Phases: `status` (row counts), `manifest` (batch metadata), `reset` (data wipe), `refs` (institutions/skills), `students` (1500 rows/batch), `credentials` (2500 rows/batch)
- Seed data stored in private `seed-data` Storage bucket as JSON chunks
- Supports incremental loading via `?phase=students&batch=N` parameters

#### `seed-users` Function
- One-shot provisioning of role-specific demo accounts
- Auto-confirms emails for immediate login capability
- Provides ready-to-use credentials for testing all role workflows

### Demo Account Credentials

| Role | Email | Institution | Password |
|------|-------|-------------|----------|
| ITI Admin | `admin@credify.in` | — | `Credify@2026` |
| Principal | `principal@credify.in` | ITI Institute 9 | `Credify@2026` |
| Trainer | `trainer@credify.in` | ITI Institute 9 | `Credify@2026` |
| Student | `priya.welder@nsr.in` | ITI Institute 9 | `Priya@2026` |

**Note**: Demo accounts are for development and testing only. Credentials should be rotated in production environments.

## Development Guidelines

### TypeScript Standards

- Strict mode enabled; minimize use of `any` type
- Define interfaces for all major data structures
- Use discriminated unions for complex state management

### Component Architecture

- Prefer functional components with React Hooks
- Use React Query for server state management
- Implement loading and error states explicitly
- Follow shadcn/ui component patterns for UI consistency

### Database Changes

1. Create new migration file: `supabase/migrations/TIMESTAMP_description.sql`
2. Apply migrations locally: `supabase db push`
3. Test schema changes thoroughly before production deployment
4. Never remove columns or tables without careful planning

### Environment Management

- Development: `.env.local` (gitignored)
- Production: Use Supabase project environment variables
- Never hardcode secrets in source code

---

## Testing

### Unit Testing

```bash
npm run test
```

### Test Watch Mode

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

Test files should be colocated with source files using `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` naming convention.

---

## Deployment

### Frontend Deployment

The application can be deployed to any static hosting service:

- **Vercel** (recommended): Direct GitHub integration with automatic builds
- **Netlify**: Supports Vite builds natively
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: Requires build artifact upload
- **Docker**: Multi-stage build for containerized deployment

### Environment Configuration

Update `VITE_*` variables in hosting platform dashboard. These variables must be accessible at build time.

### Supabase Deployment

1. Ensure all migrations are applied to production database
2. Deploy Edge Functions: `supabase functions deploy --project-id <prod-id>`
3. Update function environment variables if required
4. Test all public endpoints with production credentials

---

## Compliance and Security

### Data Protection

- All user passwords managed by Supabase Auth with bcrypt hashing
- Credentials stored with cryptographic hash identifiers
- Row-level security enforces institutional data isolation
- Audit logs capture all material state changes

### GDPR and Data Privacy

- Student data deletion supported via RLS cascading deletes
- Email-based whitelist controls data access
- Institutional isolation ensures multi-tenancy compliance
- Audit trails support regulatory investigations

### Authentication Security

- JWT tokens with automatic expiration (default: 1 hour)
- Refresh tokens for extended sessions (default: 7 days)
- HTTPS required for all communication
- CORS policies restrict API access to authorized origins

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Whitelist Error on Signup
- **Cause**: User email not in `public.whitelist` table
- **Resolution**: Verify email is added with appropriate role and institution via Admin panel

#### RLS Policy Blocks Operation
- **Cause**: User lacks required role or institutional affiliation
- **Resolution**: Check `user_roles` table; re-authenticate if needed

#### Edge Function Timeout
- **Cause**: Processing large batches in single request
- **Resolution**: Reduce batch size or split operation into multiple requests

#### QR Code Not Scanning
- **Cause**: Insufficient contrast or damaged QR code
- **Resolution**: Regenerate QR code or increase print resolution
